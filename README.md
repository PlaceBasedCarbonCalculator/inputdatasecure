# Input Data Secure

This repo is the sister of [inputdata](https://github.com/PlaceBasedCarbonCalculator/inputdata) and is used by the main Carbon & Place  [analysis repo](https://github.com/PlaceBasedCarbonCalculator/build).

Unlike `inputdata` this repo does not contain any data. Instead this repo only contains a folder structure and README files explaining where to get data that is too large or cannot be published on GitHub due to licencing restrictions.

Many of the unpublished datasets listed in this repo are freely available to UK Academics via services such as the UK Data Service or Digimap.

1. Clone this repo alongside the `build` and `inputdata` repos.
1. Fill this repo with the files ad described in the README.md files
1. Follow instruction the `build` repo.

## Licence

The [LICENCE](https://github.com/PlaceBasedCarbonCalculator/inputdatasecure/blob/main/LICENSE) file only applies to the repo without any data. Please see the data owners for information on the licence for each dataset.
